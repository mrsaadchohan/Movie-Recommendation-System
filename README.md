# Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This system provides personalized movie recommendations by analyzing user preferences and leveraging a content-based approach.

# Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those liked by the user.
Efficient Similarity Measurement: Utilizes cosine similarity for precise movie matching.
User-Friendly Input: Accepts user-provided movie names to generate tailored suggestions.
Boosted Accuracy: Achieved a 30% improvement in recommendation accuracy through optimized algorithms.
# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn for implementing cosine similarity and preprocessing.
Flask (optional) for deploying the application as a web service.
# How It Works
## Data Preparation:

Movie metadata is cleaned and processed, including titles, genres, descriptions, and other features.
A term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer is applied to text-based features.
## Similarity Calculation:

Cosine similarity measures the closeness between movie vectors.
## Recommendation Generation:

The system identifies and ranks the most similar movies based on user input.
